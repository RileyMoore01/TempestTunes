             Choosing what music to listen to can be very difficult when you donâ€™t know what you exactly want. Many people shuffle all of their saved songs or take         time to specifically tailor playlists to their own desires. Other times, you may pick an already curated playlist pushed by the app you're listening to. All these     different ways of listening to music tend to be unenjoyable in one way or another and they keep listeners from discovering new music they may love. Tempest Tunes       aims to break away from genre-defined, corporate-curated playlists and go after emotions with the most easily identifiable visualization of emotions, the weather.     Tempest Tunes will deliver music to listeners based on active weather readings for their area, so no more time will be wasted wondering what you want to listen to.     However, the biggest takeaway is that Tempest Tunes will deliver music dynamically in real-time as the weather changes. This allows users to continue listening to     music over the course of a day as their mood changes over time. Another advantage over our competition is that Tempest Tunes allows users to give feedback on what     music they feel belongs to different types of weather patterns. This ensures that there is nuance to certain weather such as "Rainy" that may be interpreted as sad     by some, and cozy by others. Tempest Tunes also urges listeners to give different music a try by categorizing songs based on their moody vibes rather than their       genre. However, you can still go into genre-defined playlists such as "Rock" to get a feel for how the genre can span multiple different feelings. Tempest Tunes       will allow users to seamlessly continue   listening to their favorite tracks while discovering new music throughout the day as their mood changes with the weather.

<p>     Once you login in through spotify, we will have you take a quick survey to see how you feel during the various weather condtions. This will allow us to get
    to know you a little better and bring optimization to our song selection. Ensuring the user has a personally curated playlist.

        On our side we will take either the google's authinicated location or have the user manually enter their zip code. From there we will call the 
    OpenWeatheMap API to find the current weather condition in their area. Then we are able to use the Spotify API to find music related to how that
    user feels off of tags that the API offers.
