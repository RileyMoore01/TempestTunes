# TempestTunes

- **Motivation**: <br />
Choosing what music to listen to can be very difficult when you don’t know what you exactly want. Tempest Tunes aims to break away from genre defined, corporate curated playlists and go after emotions with the most easily identifiable visualization of emotions, the weather. Tempest Tunes will deliver music to listeners based on active weather readings for their area, so no more time will be wasted wondering what you want to listen to. However, the biggest takeaway is that Tempest Tunes will deliver music dynamically in real time as the weather changes. This allows users to continue listening to music over the course of a day as their mood changes over time. This ensures that there is nuance to certain weather such as "Rainy" that may be interpreted as sad by some, and cozy by others. However, you can still go into genre defined playlists such as "Rock" to get a feel for how the genre can span multiple different feelings. wE will allow users to seamlessly continue listening to their favorite tracks, while discovering new music throughout the day as their mood changes with the weather.

- **Functionality**: <br />
The intended functionality is to take the current weather conditions and use those to curate a listening experience for a user. We would do this by taking the certain statistics about the weather using a weather API (OpenWeatherMap API) to generalize what genre/type of music someone would want to listen to and curate a playlist on spotify using their API that could tell us the genre and type of music. We are deciding if we want to use preset playlists or if it would randomize the playlist based on user input based on their mood combined with the data from OpenWeatherMap. This would obviously be location based, but we would most likely start in Lubbock and see if we could extend the functionality to see user location. We believe that this would differentiate us from other services (including the one already offered on Spotify). We would want this playlist to be automatically created and exported to the users specific Spotify account but we would have to see what the API allows, based on the documentation of said API we should be able to implement this functionality. We would let the user customize their playlist name but other than that it would be be predetermined when they generated the playlist 

- **Outcome**: <br />
The goal of Tempest Tunes is to provide curated music to its user based upon the current weather. In doing so, we will learn about connecting to API’s such as Spotify and OpenWeatherMap. WIth the use of an API, the end model will be purley software with no inclusion of hardware other than the computer executing the software. Now to explain a little of the user experience, users will be able to connect to our user interface and begin their curated music experience. When a new user begins, they will be prompted to select how they feel according to the selected weather status. This will tell the Tempest Tunes algorithm what to play for that user during the current weather. Once the user becomes accustomed to Tempest Tunes, they will be able to open the user interface and automatically play their music. From that point there will be features to add music to selected playlist, dislike songs and songs similar to that song, and create their own playlists for a weather type if they desire. The true outcome of Tempest Tunes is to allow the user to decide how they want to feel according to the weather and enjoy the music to enhance their mood.
